- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jia-wei-Zhang
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **Robotics/Machine Learning/...**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently at ECE department of UIUC
I'm trying to master the robot development tools chain (e.g. ROS, gazebo, RL environments) now. In free time, I would like to self-learn front-end development for fun.
